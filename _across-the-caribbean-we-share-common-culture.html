    <p>The tropical climate and landscape also shape the music, architecture, attitudes, and customs of the region.</p>
<p>The Caribbean cultural experience is a mixture of colonialism and ethnic influences. Cultures that are blended in the Caribbean are from colonial legacies and the dominant influences of ethnic groups like Africans, East Indians, and chinese.</p>
<p>Barbados retains British traditions while Antigua maintains a casual yet respectful attitude toward them, Jamaica, has a robust Afro-Caribbean influence with its Roots reggae music, Rastafarianism, and vibrant street culture of foods and music. Cuba, with its Spanish colonial history, has a distinctly Latin American flavour with its salsa music, colourful architecture, and love for cigars. The French and Dutch influences are also evident in the cuisine and language of some Caribbean countries. The Caribbean is a melting pot of cultures, each with ituniqueue blend of traditions and customs. Despite their differences, the people of the Caribbean share a common love for music, food, and a laid-back lifestyle that reflects the warmth and hospitality of the region.</p>
<p>The Caribbean culture is exported from its region to the US, Canada, and England in the form of people migrating who carry the Caribbean tradition with them. And anywhere in these parts of the world, the Caribbean culture is unique and stands out among the rest.</p>
